  JavaScript SSA/ASS Subtitle Renderer.
</p>
JASSUB is a JS wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/libass/libass">libass</a>, which renders <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alpha">SSA/ASS subtitles</a> directly in your browser. It uses Emscripten to compile libass' C++ code to WASM.

</p>

## Features
- Supports most SSA/ASS features (everything libass supports)
- Supports all OpenType, TrueType and WOFF fonts, as well as embedded fonts
- Supports anamorphic videos [(on browsers which support it)](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlvideoelement_requestvideoframecallback)
- Supports different video color spaces [(on browsers which support it)](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_videocolorspace)
- Capable of using local fonts [(on browsers which support it)](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_querylocalfonts)
- Works fast (all the heavy lifting is done by WebAssembly)
- Is fully threaded (on browsers which support it, it's capable of working fully on a separate thread)
- Is asynchronous (renders when available, not in order of execution)
- Benefits from hardware acceleration (uses hardware accelerated canvas API's)
- Doesn't manipulate the DOM to render subtitles
- Easy to use - just connect it to video element

## Isn't this just the same thing as JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus?
No. See <a href="https://thaunknown.github.io/jassub/explainer.html">this</a> comparison.

## Usage
By default all you need to do is copy the files from the `dist/` folder of the repository into the same folder as where your JS runs, then do:
```js
import JASSUB from './jassub.es.js'

const renderer = new JASSUB({
  video: document.querySelector('video'),
  subUrl: './tracks/sub.ass'
})
```
`Note:` while the `dist/` folder includes a UMD dist it still uses modern syntax. If you want backwards compatibility with older browsers I recommend you run it tru babel.

If you use a bundler like Vite, you can instead do:
```shell
npm i jassub
```

```js
import JASSUB from 'jassub'
import workerUrl from 'jassub/dist/jassub-worker.js?url'
import wasmUrl from 'jassub/dist/jassub-worker.wasm?url'

const renderer = new JASSUB({
  video: document.querySelector('video'),
  subContent: subtitleString,
  workerUrl, // you can also use: `new URL('jassub/dist/jassub-worker.js', import.meta.url)` instead of importing it as an url
  wasmUrl
})
```
## Using only with canvas
You're also able to use it without any video. However, that requires you to set the time the subtitles should render at yourself:
```js
import JASSUB from './jassub.es.js'

const renderer = new JASSUB({
  canvas: document.querySelector('canvas'),
  subUrl: './tracks/sub.ass'
})

renderer.setCurrentTime(15)
```
## Changing subtitles
You're not limited to only display the subtitle file you referenced in your options. You're able to dynamically change subtitles on the fly. There's three methods that you can use for this specifically:

- `setTrackByUrl(url):` works the same as the `subUrl` option. It will set the subtitle to display by its URL.
- `setTrack(content):` works the same as the `subContent` option. It will set the subtitle to dispaly by its content.
- `freeTrack():` this simply removes the subtitles. You can use the two methods above to set a new subtitle file to be displayed.
```js
renderer.setTrackByUrl('/newsub.ass')
```
## Cleaning up the object
After you're finished with rendering the subtitles. You need to call the `destroy()` method to correctly destroy the object.
```js
const renderer = new JASSUB(options)
// After you've finished using it...
renderer.destroy()
```
## Options
The default options are best, and automatically fallback to the next fastest options in line, when the API's they use are unsupported. You can however forcefully change this behavior by specifying options. These options are included in the JSDoc of the object, so if your editor supports JSDoc IntelliSense you will see these exact descriptions when calling methods and specifying options.

- `{Object} options` Settings object.
- `{HTMLVideoElement} options.video` Video to use as target for rendering and event listeners. Optional if canvas is specified instead.
- `{HTMLCanvasElement} options.canvas` { Optional } Canvas to use for manual handling. Not required if video is specified.
- `{'js'|'wasm'} options.blendMode` { Optional = 'js' } Which image blending mode to use. WASM will perform better on lower end devices, JS will perform better if the device and browser supports hardware acceleration.
- `{Boolean} options.asyncRender` { Optional = true } Whether or not to use async rendering, which offloads the CPU by creating image bitmaps on the GPU.
- `{Boolean} options.offscreenRender` { Optional = true } Whether or not to render things fully on the worker, greatly reduces CPU usage.
- `{Boolean} options.onDemandRender` { Optional = true } Whether or not to render subtitles as the video player renders frames, rather than predicting which frame the player is on using events.
- `{Number} options.targetFps` { Optional = true } Target FPS to render subtitles at. Ignored when onDemandRender is enabled.
- `{Number} options.timeOffset` { Optional = 0 } Subtitle time offset in seconds.
- `{Boolean} options.debug` { Optional = false } Whether or not to print debug information.
- `{Number} options.prescaleFactor` { Optional = 1.0 } Scale down (< 1.0) the subtitles canvas to improve performance at the expense of quality, or scale it up (> 1.0).
- `{Number} options.prescaleHeightLimit` { Optional = 1080 } The height in pixels beyond which the subtitles canvas won't be prescaled.
- `{Number} options.maxRenderHeight` { Optional = 0 } The maximum rendering height in pixels of the subtitles canvas. Beyond this subtitles will be upscaled by the browser.
- `{Boolean} options.dropAllAnimations` { Optional = false } Attempt to discard all animated tags. Enabling this may severly mangle complex subtitles and should only be considered as an last ditch effort of uncertain success for hardware otherwise incapable of displaing anything. Will not reliably work with manually edited or allocated events.
- `{Boolean} options.dropAllBlur` { Optional = false } The holy grail of performance gains. If heavy TS lags a lot, disabling this will make it ~x10 faster. This drops blur from all added subtitle tracks making most text and backgrounds look sharper, this is way less intrusive than dropping all animations, while still offering major performance gains.
- `{String} options.workerUrl` { Optional = 'jassub-worker.js' } The URL of the worker.
- `{String} options.wasmUrl` { Optional = 'jassub-worker.wasm' } The URL of the worker WASM.
- `{String} options.legacyWasmUrl` { Optional = 'jassub-worker.wasm.js' } The URL of the legacy worker WASM. Only loaded if the browser doesn't support WASM.
- `{String} options.modernWasmUrl` { Optional } The URL of the modern worker WASM. This includes faster ASM instructions, but is only supported by newer browsers, disabled if the URL isn't defined.
- `{String} [options.subUrl=options.subContent]` The URL of the subtitle file to play.
- `{String} [options.subContent=options.subUrl]` The content of the subtitle file to play.
- `{String[]|Uint8Array[]} options.fonts` { Optional } An array of links or Uint8Arrays to the fonts used in the subtitle. If Uint8Array is used the array is copied, not referenced. This forces all the fonts in this array to be loaded by the renderer, regardless of if they are used.
- `{Object} options.availableFonts` { Optional = {'liberation sans': './default.woff2'}} Object with all available fonts - Key is font family in lower case, value is link or Uint8Array: { arial: '/font1.ttf' }. These fonts are selectively loaded if detected as used in the current subtitle track.
- `{String} options.fallbackFont` { Optional = 'liberation sans' } The font family key of the fallback font in availableFonts to use if the other font for the style is missing special glyphs or unicode.
- `{Boolean} options.useLocalFonts` { Optional = false } If the Local Font Access API is enabled [chrome://flags/#font-access], the library will query for permissions to use local fonts and use them if any are missing. The permission can be queried beforehand using navigator.permissions.request({ name: 'local-fonts' }).
- `{Number} options.libassMemoryLimit` { Optional } libass bitmap cache memory limit in MiB (approximate).
- `{Number} options.libassGlyphLimit` { Optional } libass glyph cache memory limit in MiB (approximate).
